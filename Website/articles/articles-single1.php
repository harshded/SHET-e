          </p>

          <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">Advantages of Online Grocery Shopping</h2>
          <p>
            <img src="images/image_5_1.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
          </p>
          <p>Most of the people prefer to make online grocery shopping as it comes with many benefits giving a good
            shopping experience. You can save a lot of time, money and even avail the benefits of same day grocery
            delivery service. The reasons why customers are not going with traditional shopping may be due to a lot of
            issues like traffic, parking issues, weather conditions, need to wait near billing counters, etc. Let’s have
            a look at some of the major advantages of online grocery shopping.</p>

          <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">Huge variety of products</h2>
          <p>In online grocery shopping you can choose from a huge variety of products whereas in traditional shopping
            you may not get much space to store all the products. In traditional shopping, customers may not get a
            chance to buy from a wide range of products as compared to online grocery shopping which gives a good
            shopping experience.
          </p>

          <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">Home delivery</h2>
          <p>
            <img src="images/image_5_2.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
          </p>
          <p>The major advantage of online grocery shopping is that you get the groceries delivered to your doorstep.
            The best online grocery delivery services offer same day grocery delivery service to the customers. As today
            everyone young or old is much aware of the technology and well-versed with using smartphones, you can make
            online grocery shopping staying comfortably at your home and not carrying heavy bags as you always do in
            traditional grocery shopping.
          </p>

          <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">Better prices</h2>
          <p>In online grocery shopping you can purchase groceries for better prices as you will get the products at the
            wholesale prices only and also there will be same day delivery of products to your doorsteps. Also you can
            check the discounts and offers and avail them on the products you have purchased. When coming to traditional
            shopping, they do not keep perfect margins to sell the groceries because of which the online e-commerce
            platforms came into existence. Also, there are some of the major savings which are always ignored like
            petrol cost while travelling to supermarkets, cost for carry bags, parking space costs, food or other
            purchases you make at the Mall.
          </p>

          <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">Time saving
          </h2>
          <p>Online grocery shopping saves a lot of time as you need not spend time in traffic, do not need to spend
            much time near the billing counter in the supermarket, no parking issues, etc. You can stay at home and make
            an easy checkout and same day grocery delivery saving a lot of time doing some productive things. Through
            online grocery shopping you will not face any issues like traffic or weather conditions as you always face
            with traditional shopping.
          </p>

          <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">24/7 shopping
          </h2>
          <p>
            <img src="images/image_5_3.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
          </p>
          <p> You can conveniently shop at any time using online grocery shopping. You can browse whatever products you
            need at any time and avail same day grocery delivery services. You need not rush to the supermarkets and
            shop the groceries in your leisure time and get the groceries delivered to your doorstep. You can even
            interact with the customer care executives to resolve your queries.
          </p>

          <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">Find products easily</h2>
          <p>
            <img src="images/image_5_4.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
          </p>
          <p>While doing online grocery shopping, you may find a huge variety of products, still it is easy to find the
            products by searching on websites or apps. You can check whether the product is available or not in a single
            click rather than roaming around the supermarket to find the product therefore getting tired, which always
            happens with traditional grocery shopping.
          </p>

          <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">No unnecessary purchases</h2>
          <p>In traditional shopping along with the products you need, sometimes you may tend to buy products that are
            not necessary. But while doing online grocery shopping, you tend to buy only the products that are necessary
            for you, add them to the cart and complete the shopping, where there won’t be any unnecessary expenses. This
            is the major advantage with the online grocery shopping where you can shop quickly and get same day grocery
            delivery services.
          </p>

          <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">Not boring or tiring </h2>
          <p>Most of the customers get bored or tired within a few minutes of traditional grocery shopping which results
            in frustration. When coming to online grocery shopping you can make the shopping quickly in your convenient
            time from anywhere and experience same day delivery of products resulting in a better shopping experience.
          </p>

          <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">Simple replacement</h2>
          <p>In traditional shopping if you want to return or replace a product, you need to travel with that heavy bag
            to the shop and need to return the product. When coming to online grocery shopping, you can replace or
            return the products through the website or app in a single click and the products returned or replaced as
            per your requirement.
          </p>

          <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">Easy to reorder</h2>
          <p>
            <img src="images/image_5_5.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
          </p>
          <p>Customers cannot make reordering with traditional shopping as the products they previously purchased will
            not be saved by the grocery store owner whereas in case of online grocery shopping your list of previously
            purchased products will be maintained in a database and you can easily add them to your cart, make few
            changes if needed and complete your shopping easily and quickly.
          </p>

          <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">Conclusion</h2>
          <p>Traditional way of shopping is getting reduced as people nowadays are running out of time to visit
            supermarkets and buy necessary products. Hence online grocery shopping came into existence where customers
            can buy groceries online at any time from anywhere. Most of the supermarkets are now offering online
            services to connect with their customers easily and offer same day grocery delivery services.
